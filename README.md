## Who will use it
Cookie lovers and people on a diet looking to chance/track their cookie consumption

## Why is this project of interest to me

- I like cookies
- Thought this was a unique app idea with some utility that I could fully implement as someone new to android development
- Wanted the learning experience of completing native mobile app development from an empty project to the marketplace

## Style features
- Faded cookie background for the loading screen
- Animations between each fragment or activity
- Visually appealing dark mode which retains a similar aesthetic to the normal color scheme
- All cookie drawings are vector graphics that I created with Inkscape
- Tile background is visible behind the cookie selector and cookie history fragments when they're transitioning. I believe this helps imply that the whole app takes place in a kitchen where you're eating cookies.
- Cookie vector colors adapt with theme
- Cookie row vector graphic generated in between cookie history entries without distorting the graphic (no matter the screen size)
